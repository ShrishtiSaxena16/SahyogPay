SahyogSetu is a full-stack loan management platform designed to connect borrowers and lenders on a transparent, flexible, and secure portal. Built using React (with Vite) for a fast and responsive frontend, Node.js with Express.js for backend APIs, and PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon) as a robust relational database, the system ensures both scalability and performance. Iâ€™ve used Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI design. The platform features a chatbot integrated via IBM Cloud to assist users in real-time and a test payment gateway via Paystack to simulate loan repayments. Borrowers can submit loan requests with customized interest rates, and lenders can view a pool of such requests and approve loans based on their preferences. An admin dashboard allows for real-time user management, such as making users active/inactive. What makes SahyogSetu stand out is the borrower-lender matchmaking mechanism, multi-language support, and integrated notification system, which together create a more inclusive, user-friendly, and adaptable platform compared to traditional lending portals.
